###Block: Alternate Class Features
# Ability Name					Unique Key					Category of Ability	Type									Description																																																																																																								Ability												Modify VAR
Drow Bard (Deadly Knowledge)			KEY:Bard ~ Deadly Knowledge		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.BardBardicKnowledge					DESC:Drow bards do not travel the world, and thus do not gain the broad range of understanding other bards have. Instead, they study a means of death-dealing normally associated with other classes. Level: 1st. Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard bard's bardic knowledge ability. In addition, you can use your bardic music one fewer time per day than other bards (minimum 1).																																					ABILITY:Bard Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Bard ~ Deadly Knowledge			BONUS:VAR|BardicMusicTimes|-1
Drow Cleric (Master of Spiders)		KEY:Cleric ~ Master of Spiders	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.ClericTurnUndead					DESC:Everything you do, everything you are, is devoted heart and soul to Lolth: to spreading her power across the Underdark, and, of course, to cementing your own base of power among the drow. How better to honor the Weaver of Webs, after all, than to ensure that so potent and loyal a servant as yourself can direct her minions?																																																			ABILITY:Cleric Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Cleric ~ Master of Spiders
Drow Druid (Spider Shape)			KEY:Druid ~ Spider Shape		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.DruidWildShape						DESC:Druids are rare among drow communities. Most drow spellcasters pursue either the faith of Lolth or one of a variety of arcane paths. However, a rare few exist who seek a different, more natural connection between themselves and their subterranean environment. Drow druids forgo the ability to assume animal forms, preferring the shape of their revered totem: the spider.																																											ABILITY:Druid Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Druid ~ Spider Shape
Favored Soul (Sense Prey)			KEY:Favored Soul ~ Sense Prey		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.FavoredSoulResistance				DESC:Viewed with a combination of awe and jealous hatred by other drow, the favored soulsCD of Lolth hold substantial power in their society, but also occupy a truly precarious position. As Lolth's "elite," favored souls are expected, even more than others, to be able to defend themselves and their positions from other drow who seek to take them. Otherwise, they clearly weren't worthy after all, were they? Favored souls often compete with clerics for positions in the priesthood and other high offices.																					ABILITY:Favored Soul Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Favored Soul ~ Sense Prey
Drow Fighter (Hit-and-Run Tactics)		KEY:Fighter ~ Hit-and-Run Tactics	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.RemoveHeavyArmorProf.RemoveTowerShieldProf	DESC:Drow fighters strike fast and melt away before their opponents have a chance to mount a counterattack. Rather than using heavy armor or picking feats that emphasize direct assaults, drow fighters employ techniques that exploit their natural advantages. In exchange for a fighter's access to heavy armor, a drow fighter gains strong first-strike capability.																																													ABILITY:Fighter Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Fighter ~ Hit-and-Run Tactics
Drow Rogue (Poison Use)				KEY:Rogue ~ Poison Use			CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.RogueTrapfinding					DESC:Rogues are common in drow society, fewer in number only than clerics and wizards. They are silent killers, spies, and informants. It falls to them to gather intelligence about rival houses and to eliminate challengers within the hierarchy. For these tasks, drow rogues cultivate the ability to safely utilize poison.																																																				ABILITY:Rogue Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Rogue ~ Poison Use
Drow Swashbuckler (Swift and Deadly)	KEY:Swashbuckler ~ Swift and Deadly	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.SwashbucklerAcrobaticCharge			DESC:The drow swashbucklerCW fills an interesting niche in dark elf society. Their culture of treachery and betrayal offers opportunities for those with wit and skill to rise far. For drow, the swashbuckler class is usually a male pursuit, and well-born sons of the great houses are the most likely to cultivate the abilities this class offers. A rare few drow swashbucklers are renegades: outcasts from drow society, bucking the traditions and loyalties to the matriarchs to seek their own fortunes. Drow swashbucklers give up some of their mobility across difficult terrain to gain a more tactical understanding of movement.	ABILITY:Swashbuckler Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Swashbuckler ~ Swift and Deadly
Warlock (Venomous Blood)			KEY:Warlock ~ Venomous Blood		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.WarlockFiendishResistance				DESC:WarlocksCAr among the drow occupy an oddly dichotomous position. They have strong links to the Abyss and to Lolth, but those ties more directly bind them to Lolth's servants-her demons-than to the Spider Queen herself. Thus, although warlocks can occupy positions of power and even become priestesses, drow expect them to be serving the church and the great houses rather than running them.																																							ABILITY:Warlock Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Warlock ~ Venomous Blood
Drow Wizard (Abyssal Specialist)		KEY:Wizard ~ Abyssal Specialist	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF								DESC:Wizards are among the most feared and admired nondivine members of drow society. Despite their innate resistance to magic, the drow have great respect for both the spells and the knowledge available to these masters of the arcane arts. Although they are not directly tied to Lolth in the way divine casters and warlocks are, their devotion to the Spider Queen-and indeed, their very upbringing within society-has led to the development of race-specific wizard traits.

# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type								Description
Deadly Knowledge		KEY:Bard ~ Deadly Knowledge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature		DESC:You are trained in the use of poison. You never risk poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.
Master of Spiders		KEY:Cleric ~ Master of Spiders	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Cleric Class Feature		DESC:You can rebuke or command vermin as an evil cleric rebukes or commands undead. When commanding spiders, you gain a +4 bonus to your effective turning level. This ability otherwise works exactly as rebuke undead. You can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for divine feats.
Spider Shape		KEY:Druid ~ Spider Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Druid Class Feature		DESC:Beginning at 5th level, you can turn yourself into any Small or Medium monstrous spider. You are not mindless, and thus do not gain immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities. You can take the shape of a Large monstrous spider at 8th level, a Tiny monstrous spider at 11th level, and a Huge monstrous spider at 15th level. This class feature otherwise functions as the normal wild shape ability. It doesn't affect your ability to wild shape into plant creatures or elementals (gained at 12th and 16th level, as normal). Special: Because they have a stronger connection to scorpions than to spiders, drow in the EBERRON campaign setting who select this alternative class feature instead gain the ability to wild shape into monstrous scorpions.
Sense Prey			KEY:Favored Soul ~ Sense Prey		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Favored Soul Class Feature	DESC:Three times per day, you can use a standard action to gain tremorsense (MM 316) out to of 5 feet for 1 round per class level. This is a supernatural ability. At 10th level your tremorsense extends to 20 feet, and at 15th level to 30 feet.
Hit-and-Run Tactics	KEY:Fighter ~ Hit-and-Run Tactics	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Fighter Class Feature		DESC:At 1st level, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, when attacking a flat-footed opponent within 30 feet, you can add your Dexterity bonus (if any) as a competence bonus on weapon damage rolls.
Poison Use			KEY:Rogue ~ Poison Use			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Rogue Class Feature		DESC:You are trained in the use of poison. You are never at risk of accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.
Swift and Deadly		KEY:Swashbuckler ~ Swift and Deadly	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Swashbuckler Class Feature	DESC:When wielding two weapons, if you hit at least once with each weapon in the same round, you can take a 5- foot step as a swift action. This doesn't count against your normal limit of one 5-foot step per round, and you can use this ability even if you've already moved in the round.
Venomous Blood		KEY:Warlock ~ Venomous Blood		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Warlock Class Feature		DESC:At 8th level, you gain a +5 bonus on saves against poison. At 13th level, your blood becomes poisonous. Any creature that damages you with a bite attack, or that swallows you whole, is exposed to this poison (contact; Fort DC 10 + 1/2 your warlock level + Cha modifier; 1d3 Str/1d3 Str). You are immune to your own poisonous blood. At 18th level, you can bring the poison of your blood to the surface of your hand and apply it to a held weapon or to your next eldritch blast. It requires a move action to manifest and apply the poison, and you can do so three times per day. In this more concentrated form, initial and secondary damage are 1d6 Strength each. The poison lasts until you make an attack with the weapon or eldritch blast or until the start of your next turn, whichever comes first. Applying the poison to your eldritch blast doesn't prevent you from applying eldritch essence or blast shape invocations as normal.
Abyssal Specialist	KEY:Wizard ~ Abyssal Specialist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard Class Feature		DESC:You are considered specialized, but not in a specific school. Rather, you gain all the benefits of specialization with a group of spells that includes all those of the following subschools and/or descriptors: chaotic, compulsion, darkness, evil, and fear. You gain all the standard benefits of specialization as applied to this group of spells, as though it were a school unto itself.
